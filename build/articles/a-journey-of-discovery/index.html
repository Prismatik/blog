            <section class="article-content"><p>The discovery phase of a project is both daunting and exciting. It is where
project goals are moulded from the clay of a scope document into tangible
milestones that will be reached in the near future. Here we validate
the <em>why</em> of all the things and have the choice of a myriad of different
methods available to tickle out the right information which will help you
solve the directional puzzle that is the discovery phase. I recently stared
down the barrel of this phase and saw it as a great opportunity to get my
hands dirty with some practices I’d never tried&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to provide a high level summary of methods we use
here at Prismatik to home in on the core essentials we need to kick off a
build process. There are plenty of helpful articles out there that explain each
method in more detail, so I’ll only be taking a shallow dive into each and
provide links as I go on what I found useful if you’d like to learn&nbsp;more.</p>
<h3 id="personas">Personas</h3>
<p>First we start with personas; a way to model and summarize known and suggested
assumptions you make about the intended users of your product. They allow you
to build empathy with your users and help keep a frame of reference when
designing and building features. We work through personas with the client –
at least two for each user type – and knuckle down what personas will be
relevant for the first phase of the project. These are undoubtedly the corner
pieces of your&nbsp;puzzle.</p>
<h3 id="user-stories">User&nbsp;stories</h3>
<p>Next we move on to user stories; a breakdown of each task a user can accomplish
within the product experience. Personas slot comfortably into your user stories
as the <em>role</em> of the story. User stories help remind the team of user
motivations and most importantly, why a user wants to do&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>One aspect of the user stories we have recently introduced into our work flow
are <em>acceptance criterias</em>. These define what checks off the user story as
complete as long as the criteria is met. They can also be used to help develop
story tasks, and subsequently used later during <span class="caps">QA</span> (double bonus!). We use
<a href="https://taiga.io">Taiga</a> for managing user stories and have found it to be a
great addition to our tool&nbsp;belt.</p>
<h3 id="api"><span class="caps">API</span></h3>
<p>We’ve arrived in <span class="caps">API</span> land; all of us are big fans of
<a href="http://json-schema.org"><span class="caps">JSON</span> Schema</a> here at Prismatik and modelling your
resources with well defined schemas is a solid start. Our chief geek
<a href="https://twitter.com/davidbanham">David Banham</a> has given an
<a href="http://slides.davidbanham.com/little_schema">insightful presentation</a> on
the topic and I’d recommend you give it a&nbsp;read.</p>
<p>In the beginning you may need to make assumptions about how resources might be
modelled. These loose ends can be tightened up during the discovery phase as
you revisit your schemas in an iterative fashion. It’s important to ensure that
your <span class="caps">API</span> is a source of truth for the project. Any issues with your API will
amplify tenfold further down the road with your application logic. You don’t
want that. We use <a href="https://github.com/interagent/prmd">Heroku’s <span class="caps">PRMD</span> tool</a> to
generate <span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;docs.</p>
<h3 id="user-flows">User&nbsp;flows</h3>
<p>Now for something more visual; a representation of the user’s flow to complete
tasks within the product. User flows are represented from the user’s
perspective and should clearly identify each step taken. Concise and granular
works best — some user flows can be wickedly long — as this helps to keep
actions on point and make them digestible for discussion and improvement.
Creating user flows is a great method to work in sync with your client. The
visualisation of these flows helps everyone provide a rationale as to why a
user should be doing things to achieve things, and it becomes clear uberfast if
there are holes in the process, or superfluous actions being mapped for a user
that don’t tie in with your project goals. We use a combination of
<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows">hand sketched</a>
flows (because our drawing skills are mad good brah) and
<a href="https://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prototype">Prototype</h3>
<p>We arrive at out final deliver. We’ve done a lot of thinking about whether it’s
better to deliver <span class="caps">UX</span> documents and/or complete site experiences. We’ve landed
on placing a prototype in our client’s hands as the best thing. Client’s don’t
<em>read</em> their product; they <em>use</em> their product. Creating something usable is a
good way to summarise all of the previous methods undertaken and makes for a
powerful presentation when you can step your client through the journey of
using their product. A prototype nicely laces up decisions and rationale and a
strong focus should be made on content hierarchy and page/feature composition.
There are different levels of complexities for prototypes; they can range from
a simple point and click wireframe adventure, to something that entails feature
functionality. The decision depends on the project, time and budget available;
Recently we created a prototype using
<a href="https://github.com/google/material-design-lite">Google’s Material Design Lite</a>
and this got the job done&nbsp;nicely.</p>
<p>Trying new and different discovery methods for projects is something to be
encouraged as each project presents a unique set of challenges. Hopefully by
diving further into some of the above, it might seem a little less daunting and
may inspire you to develop and tweak your own work flow to find the right&nbsp;fit.</p>
