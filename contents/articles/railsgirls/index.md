blurb: Towards a more inclusive industry
---

At Prismatik we are of the firm opinion that our industry as a whole needs to become more inclusive.

There are lots and lots of amazing humans that contribute to tech in many and varied ways. Some of them are queer, some of them are brown, some of them are female. Sadly, though, it's often much more difficult for them to feel welcome and valued than it is for a young white male.

Wherever we see an opportunity to, we try and change that for the better.

Today, we're very proud to announce our sponsorship of [Rails Girls Sydney](http://railsgirls.com/sydney). Rails Girls is a fantastic community initiative aimed at getting women and girls involved in technology in a welcoming environment. We couldn't be happier to be helping.
