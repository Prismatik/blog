blurb: Towards a more inclusive industry
---

Women are great technologists - particularly in innovative work - and despite a positive increase in the number of women in tech, they are [still highly under-represented](http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=38595127). With shortages in the supply of trained professionals in technical disciplines and many good arguments about the [benefits of diversity in the workplace](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550), we are of the firm opinion that the tech industry as a whole would benefit from becoming more inclusive. We are committed to helping that change happen.

There are a lot of amazing humans that contribute to tech in many and varied ways, and those people are - and should be - of all genders, persuasions, skin colours, creeds and varieties. Sadly, though, it’s often much more difficult for people from under-represented groups to feel welcome and valued in tech. This is compounded by the fact that they often - although thankfully not always - have less access to the same opportunities.

The biggest challenges facing diversity in tech companies today aren't that companies are not interested in hiring people from under-represented groups; but that companies' selection criteria are subtly weighted against diversity, and their networks  don’t always naturally intersect with diverse groups. Hiring “the right person for the job” often becomes “the right person for the job right now”. That short-term bias acts against people from under-represented groups that have often had less encouragement, less access to opportunities and less valuable experience, yet whom - when given a chance - flourish into valuable employees. Employees who are not only very often great at their jobs, but more grateful and engaged than their majority-group compatriots.

We believe that wherever any of us sees an opportunity to make a positive change, we all benefit from taking that opportunity. To that end, we are very proud today to announce our platinum sponsorship of lunch at [Rails Girls Sydney](http://railsgirls.com/sydney). Rails Girls is a fantastic community initiative aimed at getting women and girls involved in technology in a welcoming environment. We couldn’t be happier to be helping.
